# Employee-Records-System

This is my Employee-Records-System.

As you can see that it has three different classes. Employee is the parent class, Manager and SalesPerson are children of Employee. The Employee class has protected variables, therefore it is only able to be accessed by the class itself, its children classes and classes in the same package. Whereas the child classes have private variables, because they only need to be accessed within the class itself.Also that I have GET and SET methods that are public, this allows the App class to set and get the details.
Employee can set the Name, Employee ID, Age, Salary, Job Title.
Manager can set the Name, Employee ID, Age, Salary, Job Title and Department.
SalesPerson can set the Name, Employee ID, Age, Salary, Job Title and Sales Target.
