# Employee-Records-System

This is my Employee-Records-System.

As you can see that it has three different classes. Employee is the parent class, Manager and SalesPerson are children of Employee. As can see, all variable are either protectect, so only have access to the class and their child classes. Whereas it is not accessible and therefore unable to change by the public. Whereas the child classes have private variable, because they only need to be accessed within the class itself. AS you can see that I have GET and SET methods, so the public is able to set the employees, manager and salesperson details.
Employee - Can set the Name, Employee ID, Age, Salary, Job Title.
Manager - Can set the Name, Employee ID, Age, Salary, Job Title and Department.
SalesPerson - Can set the Name, Employee ID, Age, Salary, Job Title and Sales Target.
